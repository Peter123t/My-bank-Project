The main objectives of this project were to analyze customer data, generate insights, and build a predictive model to determine whether a client is likely to subscribe to a term deposit.

Project Highlights:
	•	Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Removed irrelevant columns, handled missing values, and converted categorical variables into numeric formats suitable for analysis and modeling.
	•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, and correlation plots to better understand client demographics, financial behavior, and previous marketing interactions.
	•	Feature Engineering & Encoding: Applied appropriate transformations to categorical features like job, marital status, and education to make them suitable for machine learning models.
	•	Predictive Modeling: Developed and evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms, selecting the best-performing model based on accuracy and other metrics.
	•	Model Deployment (Prototype): Exported the trained model using joblib and created a simple Streamlit application that allows users to input client details and receive a prediction on subscription likelihood.

Key Insights:
	•	Clients with higher balances and those contacted fewer times in previous campaigns showed a greater likelihood of subscribing.
	•	Occupation, marital status, and education levels also played significant roles in client decision-making.

This project demonstrates how data-driven insights and predictive modeling can improve targeted marketing strategies in the banking sector.
